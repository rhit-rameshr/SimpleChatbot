This project is a simple, interactive chatbot that uses a JSON file as its knowledge base. The chatbot is designed to respond to user questions by finding the best match from its knowledge base. If the chatbot doesn't know the answer, it will prompt the user to provide the correct response, allowing the chatbot to learn and expand its knowledge base dynamically.
